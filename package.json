  "description": "Bartender APP\r CIS 4327 â€“ IS Senior Project I\r Model View Controller (MVC) Bartender Application\r Due: September 1         Individual Activity\r The  context1  for  this  assignment  is  bar  patrons  ordering  a  cocktail  via  an  online  application  and \r bartender  preparing  cocktails  based  on  the  order  queue.  In  this  application,  bar  patrons  (customer \r users)  can  perform  actions  such  as  view  cocktail  menu  and  place  an  order  for  a  cocktail  drink. \r Bartender (staff user) should be able to view the cocktail order queue and set them for pick up by \r server after it is prepared.\r To implement this online bartender application using the MVC pattern, you will need a controller to \r handle cocktails order-related actions (create, edit, and view). You will need a model for handling \r data and logic related to cocktail orders. You will need views for displaying the cocktail menu and \r order queue.\r The following provides an overview of how the user request is handled:\r 1. Index page that acts as a homepage for Bartender application from where patrons can access order \r option and from where bartenders can access order queue option.\r 2. A controller that receives the user request as an HTTP GET or POST request.\r 3. The controller examines the user request and calls the model asking it to return the cocktails bar \r menu.\r 4. The model is responsible for getting menu information from the database.\r 5. The controller will use the appropriate view to display cocktail menu data to the user.\r 6. The user reviews the menu and places an order for a cocktail drink.\r 7. The  controller  examines  user  request  and  the  parameters  and  calls  the  model  asking  it  to  store \r cocktail order information in the database.\r 8. When the bartender chooses the order queue option in the index page, the controller examines the \r user request and calls the model asking it to return the list of cocktail orders.\r 9. The model is responsible for getting cocktail order information from the database.\r 10. The controller will use the appropriate view to display cocktail orders to the user.\r The purpose of this assignment is to help your team and mentor to assess each team member's skills, \r strengths, and weakness. Also, the purpose of this assignment is to enforce each team member to start \r interacting with your mentor in an attempt to solve this problem. Mentors will use this assignment to \r determine your learning curve and kind of assistance you need to excel in the senior project class.\r 1  This  assignment  context  is  inspired  based  on  https://medium.freecodecamp.com/model-view-\r controller-mvc-explained-through-ordering-drinks-at-the-bar-efcba6255053#.21tyi7dww",
